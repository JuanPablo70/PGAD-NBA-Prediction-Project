# Final Project

1. **Data Source Selection** 

	Select one dataset from the above open data sources or any other relevant data source.
	
	Considerations: The dataset should be rich enough to allow multiple analyses and should be relevant to the student’s interests or our course objectives.

2. **Loading the dataset into a SQL** 

	Load the data set into a relational table designed in SQL database. The Professor must providethe information on a connection.

	Considerations: You can use the MySQL account provided by the professor, which is freely accessibleand will always be available while the course ends.

3. **Data Preparation**

	Load, clean, and preprocess the selected dataset using programming-based tools and libraries.
	
	Considerations: Ensure the data is ready for analysis, handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize or standardize numerical variables as necessary.
	
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** 

	Perform an initial dataset analysis using visualization techniques and statistical methods to gain insights and identify patterns, trends, and potential relationships between variables.
	
	Deliverable: An EDA report containing visualizations and observations about the dataset.

5. **Descriptive Analysis** 

	Calculate summary statistics for the dataset, such as means, medians, standard deviations, quartiles, and correlations, to provide a quantitative data description.

	Deliverable: A report describing the key statistics of the dataset and their implications.

6. **Inferential Analysis or Predictive Modeling**

	Use inferential statistics or machine learning algorithms to make predictions or draw conclusions based on the data.
	
	Deliverable: A report detailing the model selection, evaluation, and interpretation of the results, along with any actionable insights or recommendations
